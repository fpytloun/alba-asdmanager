# ALBA ASD manager
The ALBA ASD manager is a lightweight library which turns traditional HDDs into disks which is addressable as key/value disk over an IP and port: an ASD (Alternate Storage Daemon).

The ALBA ASD manager can be installed on a hypervisor host (hyperconverged) or on a x86 storage server. The hard disks managed by the ALBA ASD manager can be assigned in Open vStorage to an ALBA storage backend. 

The ALBA ASD manager is written in python.
